# predicted-field-emission-of-AlGr-composites
A predictive model using different baskets of Statistical and ML models for predicting field emission performance of graphene incorporated aluminum-based metal matrix composite under ultra-high-vacuum conditions.
Here we have used AlGr composite as the MMC.

# Why Aluminium?
As far as the materials are concerned, from the prospective of every potential composite of metal matrix composites, aluminium matrix has currently recognized appreciable attentiveness in the financial utilizations like thermo-mechanical/thermo-electrical equipment’s, automobiles, aerospace, and a massive number of infrastructure materials. The benefit with aluminium over other well-known metals is that it has the excessive presence in the earth and it’s availability. Above all, there are various distinctive properties of aluminium, e.g., low density, very good thermal conductivity, malleability, ductility and resistance due to corrosion. Similarly, Graphene is a popular carbon allotrope with outstanding physio-chemical characteristics, e.g. elevated electron mobility, excellent in-plane thermal and electrical conductivity, very good chemical and thermal stability etc. Graphene as an incorporated entity can contribute with remarkable enhancement to the inherent characteristics and effects of the metal matrix. That is why, we have chosen graphene incorporated Aluminium based metal matrix composite. The information regarding the material has been incorporated in the revised manuscript as well. The Field Emission is highly surface sensitive phenomenon. It depends upon various parameters of emitter such as work function, electrical conductivity, surface topography, emitter size, elemental composition, etc.
