Combine All Four Models (Best Approach for Stacking & Voting)
Implement Each Model Individually (Best for Bagging)

order of implementation:
1. Stacking (GPR, SVR, RF, Poly as input to meta-model) ‚Üí Uses all models effectively.
2Ô∏è‚É£ CatBoost on GPR predictions ‚Üí Best boosting model on the best first-stage model.
3Ô∏è‚É£ XGBoost on GPR predictions ‚Üí Strong, but slightly less optimized than CatBoost for small data.
4Ô∏è‚É£ LightGBM on GPR predictions ‚Üí Fast, but less reliable than CatBoost & XGBoost on small data.

Mid Tier (Still Strong, but Not as Good as GPR-Based Models)
5Ô∏è‚É£ CatBoost on SVR predictions ‚Üí SVR was second-best in Stage-1, so it should perform well here.
6Ô∏è‚É£ XGBoost on SVR predictions
7Ô∏è‚É£ LightGBM on SVR predictions

8Ô∏è‚É£ CatBoost on RF predictions ‚Üí RF was third-best in Stage-1, so boosting should improve it slightly.
9Ô∏è‚É£ XGBoost on RF predictions
üîü LightGBM on RF predictions

Lower Tier (Polynomial Regression Models, Least Likely to Perform Well)
1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ CatBoost on Polynomial Regression predictions
1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ XGBoost on Polynomial Regression predictions
1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ LightGBM on Polynomial Regression predictions

Bottom Tier (Weakest Approach)
1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Voting ‚Üí Simpler averaging, doesn‚Äôt optimize model contributions well.
1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Bagging ‚Üí Not suited for boosting strong base models.
